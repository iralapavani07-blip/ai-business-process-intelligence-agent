# Revenue Leakage & Upsell Opportunity Analysis – Subscription Business (Independent Case Study)

## Business Context

This case study is based on a typical subscription-based digital product (SaaS / OTT / EdTech model) where customers pay monthly or annually to access services.  
The business objective is to reduce revenue leakage and increase average revenue per user (ARPU) by identifying usage gaps, downgrade patterns, and upsell opportunities.

This is an independent business case study created to demonstrate analytical thinking and business problem-solving.

## Problem Statement

The business observed:
- Flat revenue growth despite steady user acquisition  
- High number of users on premium plans but using only basic features  
- Frequent downgrades after 2–3 billing cycles  

The leadership wanted to understand:
- Where revenue is leaking  
- Which users are at risk of downgrade or churn  
- Where upsell opportunities exist  

---

## Key Business Questions

1. Are users fully utilizing the features they are paying for?  
2. Which usage patterns lead to downgrades or cancellations?  
3. Can we identify users who are good candidates for upsell before they churn?

---

## Hypotheses

- Users who underutilize core premium features are more likely to downgrade.  
- Users who show a sudden drop in activity in the first 30–45 days are high churn risk.  
- Users with increasing engagement across multiple features are strong upsell candidates.

---

## Data Considered (Simulated Business Dataset)

The analysis is based on:
- User subscription plan (Basic / Pro / Premium)  
- Feature usage frequency (Feature A, B, C, D)  
- Login activity (weekly / monthly)  
- Account age (days since signup)  
- Upgrade / downgrade history  

This structure mirrors real SaaS product analytics data.

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Usage vs Plan Mapping
Mapped feature usage against subscription plans to identify:
- Premium users using only basic features  
- Pro users heavily using advanced features  

### 2. Downgrade Pattern Analysis
Tracked activity and feature usage drop before downgrade events.

### 3. Engagement Scoring
Created a simple engagement score using:
- Number of active features  
- Login frequency  
- Session consistency  

---

## Key Insights

1. 42% of Premium users were using less than 30% of premium features  
   → Indicates high risk of downgrade due to perceived low value.

2. Users who dropped Feature B usage in the first 3 weeks had 2.3x higher churn risk  
   → Feature B is a critical activation feature.

3. Users using 3+ features consistently had 35% higher lifetime value  
   → Strong candidates for upsell and long-term retention.

## Business Impact Opportunities

### Revenue Leakage Control
- Identify premium users with low usage and trigger onboarding or feature education nudges.  
- Proactively engage users before downgrade.

### Upsell Strategy
- Target high-engagement Basic/Pro users with tailored upgrade offers.  
- Use feature-based upgrade messaging instead of generic discounts.

### Retention Improvement
- Trigger alerts when user activity drops below a threshold.  
- Introduce in-app guidance for underused features.

---

## Recommendations

1. Segment users by feature adoption, not just plan type.  
2. Flag users whose engagement drops for 7+ consecutive days.  
3. Promote upgrades based on features already being explored.  
4. Add in-app walkthroughs for underused premium features.

## Why This Matters

This analysis shows how data can be used to:
- Recover hidden revenue  
- Improve customer retention  
- Increase product adoption  
- Support better business decisions
